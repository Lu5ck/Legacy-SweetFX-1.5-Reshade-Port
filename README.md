# Legacy-SweetFX-1.5-Reshade-Port
Collections of SweetFX 1.5 Shaders Ported to Reshade 3.0 and above

There are many presets based on SweetFx 1.5 on thelazy site but almost all of them are unusable now with Reshade 3 and above, either because they are obsolete or the updated shaders have new paramenters. All in all, normal users will have zero idea how to make them work again.

I too encountered this issues and too is a normal user but fortunately, there are people who helped ported the old shaders over which are now scattered all over the internet. Thus, I made this repository to put together the collections I found thus far so people can download them and use with the old presets.

Feel free to put up pull requests to add more ports you have found to this collections!
